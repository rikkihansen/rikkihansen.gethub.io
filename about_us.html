        <h2>Benefit Concert for Cerberal Palsey Awareness</h2>
        <p>We'd like to invite you to the Pacific Northwest's premier event for Cerebral Palsy awareness and fundraising. Now in it's first year, this event hopes to not only provide much needed contributions in order to financially assist those in our community, but to provide an opportunity to personally interact with those affected in the Portland area.</p>
        <p>Hosted on March 25th to celebrate Cerebral Palsy Awareness day, 100% of all revenues will be donated to local families in order to build much needed accessibility improvements to their homes. Also all attendees will be given a green colored awareness shirt for themselves as well as an additional shirt to give to a friend or family member so that knowledge of our cause will continue to spread throughout the year.</p>
        <p>By designing the event with accessibility as the number one priority we are able to offer those with CP a first chance to attend a live concert.</p>
